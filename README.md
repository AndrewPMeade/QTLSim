# QTLSim

QTLSim models the evolution of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) in a population under stabilising or directional selection. The QTL comprises genetic and environmental effects. Population size, the strength of selection, heritability, the size of the input (target) phenotypic variance and the size of the per generation mutational variance can all be set by the user. Haploid and a limited diploid modes are available. 

QTLSim does not model the genome or multiple genetic loci directly. For a more comprehensive, general purpose and flexible simulation package, see SLiM (https://messerlab.org/slim/). For a detailed description of the simulations, please see the accompanying paper. 

See ./Documents/QTLSimManual.pdf for more information.
